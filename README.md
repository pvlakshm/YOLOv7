# YOLOv7 - Road Object Detection
Given a large heterogeneous driving dataset of images, the goal is to train a model for road object detection - i.e., to accurately and automatically **classify**, **detect**, and **track** objects present therein.

**Object Classification** involves identifying and labelling specific classes in the image, such as "car", "pedestrian", or "traffic light".  
**Object Detection** then accurately localizes their positions within the image.  
Finally, **Object Tracking** follows the objects over time within a sequence of frames.

The implementation is divided along the following statges:

1, [Data Preparation](DataPreparation/README.md)  
2. [Detection](Detection/README.md)  
3. [Deployment](Deployment/README.md)  
4. [Multi-Object Tracking](MOT/README.md)
